VOICE EMOTION DETECTOR (MINI PROJECT)


This project aims to develop a voice emotion detection system that can accurately classify emotions in speech using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing various emotional speech samples, enabling it to recognize emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, neutral, and surprise.
